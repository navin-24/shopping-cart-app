              How is a value pack different from a cleanse?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  A Cleanse is a set of 6 juices to be consumed at an interval of 2.5 hrs starting 9:00 am. Value packs consist of juices which can be consumed anytime of the day.

              What is the difference between cold-pressed, homemade and packaged juices?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Existing packaged juices in the market contain preservatives, chemicals, stabilizers and are full of added sugar. While our juices are made of 100% raw fruits and vegetables, tetrapak juices in the market typically contain only 8-10% fruit or vegetables.<br><br>
                RAW Pressery juices are not pasteurized at high temperatures and contain no chemicals, preservatives, artificial colours or added sugar. In addition, household juicers or blenders involve a high-speed rotating blade or strainer, which create heat and cause oxidation, destroying vital nutrients in the juice.<br><br>
                As no heat or air is thrust through the juice during the cold-pressing process, it retains far more nutrition and living enzymes are kept intact. This allows you to absorb the maximum nutrients, vitamins and minerals possible from the raw produce.
                </p>

              I find my juice has divided into the lower sediment part and the upper clear juice fluid looks like water?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Cold-Pressed Juicing retains significant amount of fibre form the Fruits & Vegetables. Therefore, sometimes the heavier sediments tend to settle at the bottom portion of the bottle. There’s no need to worry, just Shake and Take.

              I’ve heard fibre is good for you and these juices don’t have much fibre?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Our juices contain plenty of soluble fibre as well as an abundance of vitamins, minerals and trace amount of insoluble fibre.

              How is the shelf-life 21 days?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a process in which already sealed juices are introduced into a vessel and are subjected to a high level of water pressure that eliminate harmful bacteria without altering the flavour, texture or nutritional value of the juices and thereby naturally extends its shelf life to 21 days.

              <div data-content>
                <p>
                 We strongly advise not to consume the juices after expiry date.

              The colour of my juice looks different today. What is the reason?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  As the ingredients are completely natural, the colours of raw fruit and vegetables vary with each changing season. For example, pomegranates are much lighter in the summer than in the winter months.

              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  The only way the juices can spoil if they are exposed to heat and humidity or if they are past their best before date. If your juice bottle is bloated or the juice is fizzing or smells acidic then please do not consume it. Please call us on +91 8657303303 and we will solve your doubts.

                  Keep them cool. Store them in the coldest part of your refrigerator, between 0 and 4 degrees if possible. Just like milk. Kindly adjust your refrigerator temperature as per the weather as and when needed.

              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Interestingly plastic is a better choice for us than glass for the following reasons:<br><br>
                  Plastic uses less energy than glass to be recycled.<br>
                  It is lighter than other bottle options, which means less fuel is used to create and deliver each bottle.

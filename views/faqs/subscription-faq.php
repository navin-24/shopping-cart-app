              How is it different from a value pack?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  With Value Packs, you must manually (online or by calling on +91 8657303303) repeat your order whereas with subscriptions you go on auto-pilot and your juices get delivered without placing an order repeatedly.

              <button data-control>
              What is the difference between cold-pressed, homemade and packaged juices?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Existing packaged juices in the market contain preservatives, chemicals, stabilizers and are full of added sugar. While our juices are made of 100% raw fruits and vegetables, tetrapak juices in the market typically contain only 8-10% fruit or vegetables.<br><br>
                RAW Pressery juices are not pasteurized at high temperatures and contain no chemicals, preservatives, artificial colours or added sugar. In addition, household juicers or blenders involve a high-speed rotating blade or strainer, which create heat and cause oxidation, destroying vital nutrients in the juice.<br><br>
                As no heat or air is thrust through the juice during the cold-pressing process, it retains far more nutrition and living enzymes are kept intact. This allows you to absorb the maximum nutrients, vitamins and minerals possible from the raw produce.

              How many days does the juice last after opening?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Just like Natural Food Products which do not have any preservatives; our Juices are meant for Immediate Consumption and are best enjoyed within 2-3 hours of opening (if not refrigerated). Refrigeration helps you enjoy the juice up to 72 hours.
                </p>

              I find my juice has divided into the lower sediment part and the upper clear juice fluid looks like water?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Cold-Pressed Juicing retains significant amount of fibre from Fruits & Vegetables. Therefore, sometimes the heavier components, like fibre tend to settle down causing sedimentation at the bottom portion of the bottle. There’s no need to worry, just Shake and Take.
                </p>

             I’ve heard fibre is good for you and juices don’t have much fibre?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Our juices contain plenty of soluble fibre as well as an abundance of vitamins, minerals and trace amount of insoluble fibre.

              What is HPP and how does it increase the shelf-life to 21 days?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a process in which already sealed juices are introduced into a vessel and are subjected to a high level of water pressure that eliminate harmful bacteria without altering the flavour, texture or nutritional value of the juices and thereby naturally extends its shelf life to 21 days.

              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  We strongly advise not to consume the juices after expiry date.

              The colour of my juice looks different today. What is the reason?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  As the ingredients are completely natural, the colours of raw fruit and vegetables vary with each changing season. For example, pomegranates are much lighter in the summer than in the winter months.

              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  The only way the juices can spoil if they are exposed to heat and humidity or if they are past their best before date. If your juice bottle is bloated or the juice is fizzing or smells acidic then please do not consume it. Please call us on +91 8657303303 and we will solve your doubts.

                <p>
                  Interestingly plastic is a better choice for us than glass for the following reasons:<br><br>
                   Plastic uses less energy than glass to be recycled.<br>
                   It is lighter than other bottle options, which means less fuel is used to create and deliver each bottle.

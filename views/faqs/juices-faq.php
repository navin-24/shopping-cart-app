                                What is the difference between cold-pressed, homemade and packaged juices?
                            </button>
                            <div data-content>
                                <p>
                                    Existing packaged juices in the market contain preservatives, chemicals, stabilizers and are full of added sugar. While our juices are made of 100% raw fruits and vegetables, tetrapak juices in the market typically contain only 8-10% fruit or vegetables.<br><br>
                                    RAW Pressery juices are not pasteurized at high temperatures and contain no chemicals, preservatives, artificial colours or added sugar. In addition, household juicers or blenders involve a high-speed rotating blade or strainer, which create heat and cause oxidation, destroying vital nutrients in the juice.<br><br>
                                    As no heat or air is thrust through the juice during the cold-pressing process, it retains far more nutrition and living enzymes are kept intact. This allows you to absorb the maximum nutrients, vitamins and minerals possible from the raw produce.
                                </p>

                                How many days does the juice last after opening?
                            </button>
                            <div data-content>
                                <p>
                                    Just like Natural Food Products which do not have any preservatives; our Juices are meant for Immediate Consumption and are best enjoyed within 2-3 hours of opening (if not refrigerated). Refrigeration helps you enjoy the juice up to 72 hours.
                                </p>

                                I find my juice has divided into the lower sediment part and the upper clear juice fluid looks like water?
                            </button>
                            <div data-content>
                                <p>
                                    Cold-Pressed Juicing retains significant amount of fibre from Fruits & Vegetables. Therefore, sometimes the heavier components, like fibre tend to settle down causing sedimentation at the bottom portion of the bottle. There’s no need to worry, just Shake and Take.

                                I’ve heard fibre is good for you and juices don’t have much fibre?

                                    Our juices contain plenty of soluble fibre as well as an abundance of vitamins, minerals and trace amount of insoluble fibre.

                                    High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a process in which already sealed juices are introduced into a vessel and are subjected to a high level of water pressure that eliminate harmful bacteria without altering the flavour, texture or nutritional value of the juices and thereby naturally extends its shelf life to 45 days.

                                The colour of my juice looks different today. What is the reason?

                                <p>
                                    As the ingredients are completely natural, the colours of raw fruit and vegetables vary with each changing season. For example, pomegranates are much lighter in the summer than in the winter months.

                                    The only way the juices can spoil if they are exposed to heat and humidity or if they are past their best before date. If your juice bottle is bloated or the juice is fizzing or smells acidic then please do not consume it. Please call us on +91 8657303303 and we will solve your doubts.

                                    Keep them cool. Store them in the coldest part of your refrigerator, between 0 and 4 degrees if possible. Just like milk. Kindly adjust your refrigerator temperature as per the weather as and when needed.

                                    Interestingly plastic is a better choice for us than glass for the following reasons:<br><br>
                                    Plastic uses less energy than glass to be recycled.<br>
                                    It is lighter than other bottle options, which means less fuel is used to create and deliver each bottle.

                                    We are very happy to know the common love we share for our planet. Rawcycled, a sustainability initiative by Raw Pressery collects empty bottles and transform them into tshirts. 7 Bottles make 1 tshirt.<br/><br/>
                                    <!--If you'd like to be part of this initiative, please visit https://rawcycled.com/pages/get-involved and if you have more than 20 bottles, we will have them collected. Alternatively, you can also send your bottles to us for recycled to the address mentioned on the website.<br/><br/>-->
                                    Currently due to Covid-19 safety measures we are unable to do any collections or receive any empty bottles from you. We will keep you updated as soon as we can restart collections.

                                    Our green juices like TRIM (Kale, Spinach, Doodhi, Amla, Celery, Green Apple, Ginger, Lemon) AND LEAN (Spirulina, Kiwi, Kale, Cucumber, Green Apple, Mint) are popular with diabetics. They are rich in leafy greens and are a powerhouse of nutrients that help alkalize your system. We recommend you contact your physician before consuming the juices.

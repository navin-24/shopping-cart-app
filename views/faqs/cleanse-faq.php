              Isn't it true that our bodies are capable of cleansing naturally? If so, why should I partake in the cleansing trend?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  It is definitely true to say that our bodies cleanse naturally and constantly but with the stress of modern life, processed food, pollution and other environmental factors, we need a little extra help. We like to think of our cleanse program as a way to reset healthy eating habits and give our digestive system a break. Cleansing is a great way to bring balance into your life.

                <p>
                  <u>2-3 days prior to the cleanse:</u><br><br>
                      Dos:<br>
                      H2O: Drink plenty of water to hydrate your system.<br>
                      Eat Light: Incorporate plenty of raw fruits and salads.<br><br>
                      Don’ts:<br>
                      No Red Meat, Dairy and Gluten<br>
                      No Alcohol and Nicotine<br>
                      No Caffeine<br><br>
                      Post-Cleanse:<br>
                      Day 1: Add in raw fruits, salads, nuts & seeds and light veggie soups.<br>
                      Day 2: Add in gluten-free grains (e.g. brown rice) and lentils.<br>
                      Day 3: Add small servings of animal products and eggs if you wish.<br><br>
                      Don’t jump into anything too strenuous straight after your juice cleanse. It is best to see how you feel and take things at your own pace.<br><br>

              Will I lose weight on a cleanse?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Our cleanses help with weight management and reduce water retention. While they are primarily designed for cleansing your system, you may find that the scales shift and that you lose weight as your body flushes out excess water and toxins. Cleansing on a regular basis will help to restore natural balance and enhance your shape.

              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Value packs consist of juices which can be consumed anytime of the day. Whereas a cleanse is a set of 6 juices to be consumed at an interval of 2.5 hrs starting 9:00 am.

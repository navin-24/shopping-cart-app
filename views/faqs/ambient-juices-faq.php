                                How many days does the juice last after opening?

                                    Our juices can be stored in ambient temperature before opening. With advancement in processing technology, our 100% juices enjoy extended shelf life of 4 months. Our products do not have any preservatives or artificial additives. On opening, our juices are meant for Immediate Consumption and are best enjoyed within 2-3 hours of opening (if not refrigerated).

                                I find my juice has divided into the lower sediment part and the upper clear juice fluid looks like water?
                            </button>
                            <div data-content>
                                <p>
                                    Cold-Pressed Juicing retains significant amount of fibre from Fruits & Vegetables. Therefore, sometimes the heavier components, like fibre tend to settle down causing sedimentation at the bottom portion of the bottle. There’s no need to worry, just Shake and Take.

                                I’ve heard fibre is good for you and juices don’t have much fibre?

                                    Our juices contain plenty of soluble fibre as well as an abundance of vitamins, minerals and trace amount of insoluble fibre.

                                The colour of my juice looks different today. What is the reason?
                            </button>
                            <div data-content>
                                <p>
                                    As the ingredients are completely natural, the colours of raw fruit and vegetables vary with each changing season. For example, pomegranates are much lighter in the summer than in the winter months.

                                    The only way the juices can spoil if they are exposed to heat and humidity or if they are past their best before date. If your juice bottle is bloated or the juice is fizzing or smells acidic then please do not consume it. Please call us on +91 8657303303 and we will solve your doubts.

                                    Keep them cool. Store them in the coldest part of your refrigerator, between 0 and 4 degrees if possible. Just like milk. Kindly adjust your refrigerator temperature as per the weather as and when needed.

                                Why don’t you use glass bottles?

                                <p>
                                    Interestingly plastic is a better choice for us than glass for the following reasons:<br><br>
                                    Plastic uses less energy than glass to be recycled.<br>
                                    It is lighter than other bottle options, which means less fuel is used to create and deliver each bottle.

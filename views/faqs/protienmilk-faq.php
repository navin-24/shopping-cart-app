              What is the difference between whey protein, regular milkshakes, and Raw Pressery High Protein Milkshake?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  There are 2 kinds of protein in milk; whey & casein. The product whey protein, as the name suggest consists only one of the 2 proteins in milk or is formed as a by-product of cheese making. On the other hand, regular milkshakes or even a normal glass of 200 ml milk contain only 6g or less amount of protein. Raw Pressery’s high Protein Milkshakes combines the best of both worlds and offers 3 times more protein than regular milk / milkshake i.e 18g per 200 ml. It also contains both casein & whey in the ration 80:20 and contains very little fat & carbohydrates, is loaded with amino acids and is very easy to digest for children, young adults and seniors. Daily Protein. Dairy Protein.

                  MPIs are Milk Protein Isolates and they retain the casein to whey protein ratio of 80:20 in pure milk. They contain very little fat and carbohydrates and are loaded with a very high amino-acids composition. Very easy to digest for children and young adults with a bioavailability of over 90%. All Good.

              What does bioavailability mean?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Bioavailability is the percentage of protein which can be easily absorbed and digested by the body. At 90% MPI’s are more easily absorbed than any other source. Muscle Up. Weight Down.

              How much protein do I need daily?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  Your protein requirement depends on your age, body weight and other factors such as your fitness regime and diet intake. As per ICMR, the average daily requirement for kids (9-18 years) is 30g, adults (19-60 years) is 60g and seniors (60+ years) is 40g. Each bottle of our protein milkshake approximately fulfils 30% of you daily protein requirement.

                <p>
                  It’s always a great time to have a milkshake. But we’d say the best time is between meals; because that’s when we cheat the most.

              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  We wouldn’t call this a meal replacer however it’s a great way to balance your meals as protein makes you feel full and thereby also helps in weight management.

              Is this a pre or post workout drink?
              </button>
              <div data-content>
                <p>
                  We would recommend consuming 90 mins before you hit the gym so that the protein is well digested and kicks in at the right time to fuel your workout. Alternatively, you can also use it as a post workout drink as the muscles absorb MPIs faster with 90% bioavailability.
